Object-Oriented Code Risk Classification: A Machine Learning Approach
📌 Project Overview
This repository serves as the official documentation for my Bachelor’s Thesis in Software Analysis and Development at IBMEC. It contains the complete technical article detailing a research study on software quality and predictive analytics.

The research focuses on using Machine Learning to identify defect-prone areas in Java projects by analyzing object-oriented metrics.

📖 What this Repository Contains
This repository is dedicated to the complete technical documentation and results of the research:

The Full Article: A detailed paper covering the methodology, data extraction, and statistical findings.

Comprehensive Analysis: In-depth explanation of how Random Forest was applied to predict software risks.

Detailed Results: Discussion on accuracy, precision, and the impact of specific metrics like Structural Size and Dynamic Coupling.

🧪 Research Methodology & Technical Highlights
The paper explains a data-driven pipeline designed to improve software preventive maintenance:

Metric Extraction: Analysis of 15 open-source Java projects from GitHub.

Algorithm: Application of Random Forest to handle non-linear relationships and rank feature importance.

Data Science in R: Utilization of the R language for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and handling class imbalances.

📊 Summary of Results
Performance: The proposed model achieved an accuracy of 72.84%.

Predictive Factors: The study concludes that Structural Size (NOS) and Dynamic Coupling (RFC) are the strongest indicators of code defects.

📂 File Structure
